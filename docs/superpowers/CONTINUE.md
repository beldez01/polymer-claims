## Current state (2026-06-29) — authoritative snapshot

> **This is the single current-state summary.** The dated blocks further down are **historical**
> (kept for build detail); when they disagree with this section, *this* section wins. Full shipped
> history is in the **Done checklist** below + `git log`; the forward plan is
> `docs/superpowers/2026-06-23-remaining-roadmap.md` (Path α — wedge-first).

**Where it stands.** `main` is a single trunk, ruff clean, all suites green:
**umbrella 572 · grammar 427 · protocol 431** (+ the grammar isolation guard) + viewer `tsc`/build.
`grammar/` + `protocol/` stay pure + numpy-free; **Corpus = exactly 4 collections**; numpy lives
behind the umbrella `[embed]` extra. **The `beldez01` account flag is RESOLVED (2026-06-29)** —
GitHub Actions / PyPI publish are unblocked (no CI workflow committed yet; `scripts/check-all.sh`
remains the local gate until one mirroring it is added).

**Shipped (newest first):**
- **V2.0 Slice 1 — evidence-licensed capability (2026-06-29, merge `9b8848c`, LOCAL only — not yet
  pushed; main is now ahead of origin/main).** A second, honest licensing route that is NOT the
  two-adapter recompute air-gap: a 4th capability `eval::benchmark_advantage@v1` whose claim is
  identified by its plan's `execution_contract` (bound by `commitment_hash`), dispatched **in-cycle,
  post-commit** in `execute_ground` to an injected `EvidenceExecutor` (protocol-typed; numpy impl
  umbrella-side) instead of `verify()`. It scores a model-vs-**precommitted-baseline** benchmark
  advantage as a **paired sequential betting e-value** (reuses the GRAPA core), and `verify_stage`
  mints `LicenseRoute.EVIDENCE_LICENSED` (new) **only on e-LOND discovery + the standard eligibility
  gates** (selection, commit, mandatory pre-registration with locked α, grounded-extension,
  commitment-match) with a 5-field ledger-equality check. **The e-LOND discovery IS the decision** (no
  separate criterion); the BH bar is honestly exempt (e-LOND is the multiplicity control). New grammar:
  `EvidencePolicy`/`ExecutorDescriptor`+`ExecutorTrustEntry` (content-addressed, validated registries),
  `VerificationPolicy`/`ExecutionContract`/`EvidenceProvenance`, `verification_standing`, optional
  `CapabilityCell.verification_policy`+`content_hash`, optional `EvaluationPlan.execution_contract`,
  `DataRefKind.BENCHMARK`, `PendingReason.EXECUTION_ERROR`. **Compat byte-clean:** drop-when-None
  `model_serializer`s keep ALL existing attestation/commitment/cell hashes byte-identical
  (git-verified zero golden drift, no re-bless). Content-addressed end-to-end (whole-executor
  credential + hash chain checked before scoring). Built via 19 subagent-driven TDD tasks (each
  task-reviewed, risky ones opus-reviewed; final whole-branch opus review READY-TO-MERGE, no
  Critical/Important). Suites: umbrella 697, grammar 568, protocol 467, isolation. **Honest scope
  caveats:** the demo benchmark/fixture is a mechanics demonstration (powered DGP, not real biology);
  label-blindness is **credential-enforced** (a label-peeking predictor changes the implementation hash
  → fails Layer-3) not structural. Spec v8 + plan v3: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-29-v2-evidence-licensed-capability*`.
  **Deferred follow-ons:** Slice 2 (full attestation chain + certificate/SLSA `resolvedDependencies`);
  Slice 3 (defeat/drift/reinstatement/replay-over-time + tamper depth + downgraded-oracle); the ~14
  triaged Minor findings (all DEFER — coverage/cosmetic; recorded in `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`).
- **Audit-driven cleanup + docs consolidation (2026-06-28→29).** A multi-agent tidiness/correctness
  audit (`CLEANUP_AUDIT.md`) applied as ~110 verified changes: **2 real correctness fixes** — the MDL
  meta-tier gate could be fooled by zero-structural-slot claims (a load-bearing pattern DEPRECATE
  wrongly cleared the bar), and `anchored_resolutions` emitted records in non-deterministic order
  (→ a non-deterministic signed certificate digest) — plus condensation/refactors across all packages
  (the 3 LLM adapters unified onto `_GenerationAdapterBase`; `_ndmp_gate` shared by both kernel proofs;
  `node` ring buffer → `deque(maxlen)`; serve mode-flags now mutually exclusive — argparse error vs
  silent shadowing). **Docs culled −63k lines:** shipped per-feature specs/plans + the entire
  `docs/superpowers/archive/` tree removed (history in git); `specs/`+`plans/` keep only the 2 pending
  features; the two spectral docs merged to `docs/spectral-layout.md`.
- **Capability Cell + Registry (V1, 2026-06-27, merge `b058d3c`).** First-class versioned
  `CapabilityCell` + `CapabilityRegistry`; the three reductions registered as the first cells;
  conformance is advisory (closed-world enforcement deliberately deferred).
- **Local transparency-log layer (H1.A1, 2026-06-25)** — RFC-6962 Merkle inclusion log + C2SP signed
- **Local transparency-log layer (H1.A1, 2026-06-25)** — RFC-6962 Merkle inclusion log + C2SP signed
  checkpoint + a trust-gated, offline-verifiable Polymer bundle (Sigstore-INSPIRED, not
  wire-compatible), behind a `TransparencyLog` seam. CLI `verify-bundle PATH [--pub-key]
  [--log-pub-key]` (rc 0 needs BOTH pinned keys) + `--transparency-log` on
  `certify`/`export-attestation`. **Honest boundary:** tamper-evidence + inclusion proofs + signed
  timestamps, but NOT public non-repudiation and NOT verified append-only-ness. The **networked Rekor
  backend** is DESIGNED but **intentionally tabled** (`--rekor-url` reserved + errors; spec
  `specs/2026-06-26-networked-rekor-backend-design.md`, status DEFERRED — do first-use work first).
- **Real signing (H1.A1, 2026-06-25)** — local ed25519 DSSE (`keygen`/`verify-dsse`, opt-in `--key`,
  `[sign]` extra). Real signing is no longer deferred.
- **Kernel proof (H0.1 / H0.1b, 2026-06-25)** — `verify-kernel` (synthetic, offline, CI-guarded —
  proves pipeline integrity) + `verify-kernel --real` (rebuilds `se:tcga_laml_idh@2` from 3 pinned
  inputs, byte-level `contract_checksum` parity, real n-DMP gate → `LICENSED @ REPRODUCED`; real pins
  captured + verified). **H0.1b fully closed.**
- **BioNeMo evidence-adapter (Phase 1)** — a cached NVIDIA NIM run licenses a claim offline;
  oracle-dossier bound; air-gap independence witnessed.
- **(≤2026-06-22, also current)** calibration ledger + certificate (`q` validated not asserted;
  `certify`/`calibrate`), ATTESTED ingestion (`ingest-attested`), attestation export
  (in-toto/SLSA/DRS, `--format dsse`), sheaf consistency gauge + viewer overlay, §E common-cause,
  pre-registration ledger.

**Standing caveats (carry forward — the honest limits):**
- **n-DMP / REPRODUCED is EARNED** on a real TCGA-LAML HM450 cohort (IDH-mut vs WT; e-value → ∞; IDH
  source = cBioPortal complete genotyping `tcga_laml_idh@2`, IDH-mut n=36; n_dmps=115,405). Real betas
  local-only, gitignored.
- **Region-Δβ is PENDING (FDR-withheld, NOT refuted):** held-out betting e-value 5.672 < the e-LOND
  first-test threshold 32.90 (τ fixed at 0.10 — no tuning). A comparable 2nd real cohort would license
  it at §2E REPLICATED.
- **REPLICATED is still synthetic** — earning it on real data is **data-access-gated** (no open HM450
  AML cohort exposes machine-readable IDH; the binding machinery already works).
- Python/R hash parity deferred (needs an R serializer); adapter owner/trust provenance still
  operator-authored (implementation hashes are byte-derived).

## ▶ NEXT (concrete plan)

The single remaining **critical-path** gate is **H1.A2 — source a real 2nd HM450 cohort** with
machine-readable IDH status (long lead; it's the gate to §2E REPLICATED and a shippable wedge, H2).
Optional parallel, non-blocking code: finish **H1.A1** (Sigstore/cosign/Rekor — currently tabled by
choice), the **Track B credence engines** (proper/surrogate scoring atop the ATTESTED typing), and the
**capability-cell follow-ons**: **V2.0 Slice 1 — the generalization test — SHIPPED (2026-06-29, local
`9b8848c`)**; the evidence-licensed executor route now exists (see Shipped above). Remaining: **V2.0
Slice 2** (attestation/SLSA for the evidence route) + **Slice 3** (defeat/drift/replay hardening); the
**V2.1+ menu fan-out** now that the abstraction generalized past the 3 reductions; and eventually
closed-world enforcement. **The V2.0 Slice 1 merge is LOCAL-only — `git push origin main` when ready
(main is ahead of origin/main).**
Authoritative forward plan: `docs/superpowers/2026-06-23-remaining-roadmap.md` (see *Vision-derived
additions*); product vision: `docs/superpowers/vision.md`.

Rhythm: `superpowers:brainstorming` (2–3 forks → spec → plan) →
`superpowers:subagent-driven-development` → merge `--no-ff` → update this file + memory.

## Current state (2026-06-25 — transparency-log layer shipped)

> **UPDATE 2026-06-25 — H1.A1 local transparency layer shipped (`feat/transparency-log`):** a local RFC-6962 Merkle inclusion log + C2SP signed checkpoint + a trust-gated, offline-verifiable Polymer bundle (Sigstore-INSPIRED, not wire-compatible), behind a `TransparencyLog` seam. New CLI: `verify-bundle PATH [--pub-key] [--log-pub-key]` (rc 0 needs BOTH pinned keys) and `--transparency-log` on `certify`/`export-attestation`. **Honest boundary:** the local log delivers tamper-evidence, Merkle inclusion proofs, signed timestamps, and fully offline-verifiable bundles — but NOT public non-repudiation and NOT verified append-only-ness (consistency proofs are deferred). Those properties land when the NETWORKED backend ships. Still open: the networked public-Rekor backend (`--rekor-url` is reserved and errors today) and consistency proofs. The spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-25-transparency-log-design.md`) is now marked SHIPPED (local-first) v0.3. Next open slice = networked Rekor backend + consistency proofs.

## Current state (2026-06-25)

> **UPDATE 2026-06-25 — shipped since the 2026-06-22 snapshot below (newest first), all merged to `main` and pushed (`main == origin/main`, HEAD `32670bb`):**
> - **H0.1b — real-data kernel parity gate `verify-kernel --real`** (merged `32670bb`). Rebuilds the real `se:tcga_laml_idh@2` proof from three pinned external inputs (Xena matrix; cBioPortal mutations file @ datahub commit; cBioPortal sample-list API response) via a de-hardcoded builder (`ingest/tcga_xena.py`), asserts **byte-level `contract_checksum` parity** (+ a diagnostic `canonical_checksum`) and gate-result parity vs committed pins, runs the real n-DMP gate, requires `LICENSED @ REPRODUCED`. New: `ingest/_pinned.py` (opt-in-fetch resolver), `real_kernel_proof.py` (runner), `ingest/real_kernel_pins.json` (the **real captured pins**), `scripts/bootstrap_real_kernel_pins.py` (two-mode no-self-fulfilling-parity capture). Proves the *pinned computation* reproduces — **not** data veracity (that's H1.A2). Built via subagent-driven TDD (6 tasks + whole-branch review, ruff clean, 26 feature tests green). Spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs/2026-06-25-h01b-real-kernel-parity-design,plans/2026-06-25-h01b-real-kernel-parity}.md`. **Real pins captured + verified (2026-06-25):** the two-mode bootstrap ran, the new builder reproduced the trusted `@2` addresses exactly (clean diff), the real pins are committed, and `verify-kernel --real` returns **`LICENSED @ REPRODUCED`** end-to-end (n_probes=378,894; n_dmps=115,405; e-value=∞; IDH-mut n=36). **H0.1b fully closed — acceptance criterion #5 satisfied.**
> - **H0.1 — offline synthetic kernel proof `verify-kernel`** (CI-guarded `test_kernel_proof_synthetic.py`). Deterministic HM450-shaped fixture through the *real* n-DMP gate → `LICENSED @ REPRODUCED`; proves pipeline integrity offline (no real bytes). Runbook: `docs/superpowers/2026-06-23-kernel-proof-runbook.md`.
> - **H1.A1 — real DSSE signing (local ed25519)** (`feat/dsse-signing`). DSSE PAE + `keygen`/`verify-dsse` + opt-in `--key` on `certify`/`export-attestation` (`[sign]` extra). **Real signing is no longer "deferred."** Still open: Sigstore/cosign/**Rekor** transparency-log layer.
> - **BioNeMo evidence-adapter (Phase 1)** (`feat/bionemo-evidence-adapter`). Worked example where a cached NIM run licenses a claim offline; oracle-dossier bound; air-gap independence witnessed.
>
> **▶ Next:** the single remaining critical-path gate is **H1.A2 — source a real 2nd HM450 cohort** with machine-readable IDH status (long lead — the gate to §2E REPLICATED and a shippable wedge, H2). Optional parallel code: finish H1.A1 (Sigstore/Rekor) and the credence engines (Track B). (H0.1b is fully closed — real pins captured + `verify-kernel --real` verified LICENSED @ REPRODUCED.)

## Current state (2026-06-22)

`main` GREEN — **378 umbrella + 396 grammar + 423 protocol + 2 isolation** (1199 tests; HEAD `176544d`, pushed to origin — `main == origin/main`), ruff clean; full protocol + umbrella suites green. grammar/protocol pure + numpy-free; **Corpus = 4 collections**.

**Recently shipped (newest first):** **DEFINITIONAL bootstrap CI** (calibration roadmap **slice 5/5**; `176544d`) — a deterministic percentile bootstrap over the per-batch FDPs (umbrella-side `calibration_stats.py`, seeded — protocol stays pure) replaces the normal-approx for the headline-`q` interval when ≥2 batches; pure `definitional_batch_fdps` extracted + reused; CLI `calibrate --batches` default 12→30. **Calibration follow-up roadmap: slices 1,2,3,5 DONE; slice 4 (ATTESTED ingestion) is next** (the foundation-grounded credence layer — roadmap `.claude/plans/cozy-growing-naur.md`; **design spec WRITTEN, awaiting review+build: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-22-attested-ingestion-design.md`** v0.1 — file ingester + resolvability typing + q_attested; attested-as-defeasible-corpus-claim via `source_claim_id`; resolvability = operator-declared + structural prior; scoring engines deferred). Real signing deferred. **▶ a new instance: harden the slice-4 spec through review passes, then build it (brainstorm→spec→plan→subagent rhythm).** · **q_anchored exposure-weighted hazard** (calibration roadmap **slice 3/5**; `ef69644`) — warrant survival is now exposure-aware: `ResolutionRecord.exposure_start_cycle` (the cycle the epoch was licensed; `EpochAllocator` stamps + persists it), and `_anchored_stat` reports a `hazard_rate` = failures per claim-cycle of exposure (pure, numpy-free), surfaced on the certificate. Additive — old ledgers without the clock are excluded from the hazard but still get the proportion. KM curve deferred. · **ANCHORED drift-survival → UPHELD** (calibration roadmap **slice 2/5**; `09fc821`) — `q_anchored` is now a real survival *rate*, not a failure *count*: a claim that stays LICENSED through a DRIFT re-check (examined, not in `last_drift.drifted`) records an UPHELD warrant-survival event. `observe_anchored` gains `drift_ran`; the per-`(claim,epoch)` fold collapses repeats. Deferred (clean): `superseded` (re-license-after-reopen) + red-team-survival (daemon not live in v1). · **`serve --calibration` — live calibration accrual** (calibration follow-up roadmap **slice 1/5**; `17611a0`) — the live node now records ANCHORED warrant-survival to a ledger; off by default (byte-identical). `loop`/`run-cycle` call `run_cycle` directly (no NodeRunner tick), so accrual is serve-only. Roadmap: `.claude/plans/cozy-growing-naur.md` (slices 2-5: ANCHORED survival signals → q_anchored exposure model → ATTESTED ingestion → bootstrap CI; signing deferred). · **Calibration ledger + certificate** (`q` validated not asserted — warrant-tiered DEFINITIONAL realized-FDR through the real gate / ANCHORED warrant-survival / ATTESTED stub; single-claim attestable `certify` certificate; instrument not a gate; merged `9e54684`) · Attestation DSSE export (arc 2 slice 2 — `export-attestation --format dsse`, NDJSON of unsigned DSSE envelopes) · standards-skin attestation slice 1 (`export-attestation` bundle — in-toto Statement v1 / SLSA Provenance v1 + GA4GH DRS) · Sheaf gauge live viz (one opt-in "consistency overlay" toggle: energy HUD, tension halos, animated H¹ frustration-cycle overlay, obstruction panel; new throttled `GET /consistency` route) · Sheaf consistency gauge · §E common-cause REPLICATED + Phase D slices 1+2 (2026-06-19). Details in *Recently shipped* / the Done checklist below.

**Viewer-build caveat:** `npm run typecheck` passes; the `next build` step of `scripts/check-all.sh` can fail *only* because the sandbox cannot fetch Inter/JetBrains Mono from Google Fonts at build time (a network block, not a code defect — the build passes when network is available). All pytest suites + ruff + isolation + viewer typecheck are green.

**Repo reconciled to a single trunk (2026-06-19).** The git tangle is gone: ~9 stacked feature branches
were fast-forwarded into `main` (zero divergence, nothing lost), all stale local + remote branches
pruned, and **`main` pushed to `origin` (`origin/main == main`)**. The account flag is RESOLVED, so the
old "local-only, never push" rule no longer applies — `main` is now kept in sync with origin.

**Repo hygiene (2026-06-17):** a full cleanup pass — `docs/` consolidated (one canonical spec +
this file + the forward roadmap + the Phase-2 vision docs under `docs/superpowers/`; everything
historical under `archive/`); the closed external audit archived; obsolete v1.2 migration scripts +
dev-only fixture generators removed; one dead helper (`io.load_claim`) dropped. **v1.2 retired from
the repo** (moved out to a local sibling, preserved pending deletion — the v1.3 system never
depended on it; isolation-guard enforced). Runtime is unchanged — the test counts above still
describe `main`.

What the system *is* — the full architecture (grammar → protocol → node → viewer; the e-value-native
epistemic core; real computation + CES) — lives in the canonical spec
**`docs/superpowers/polymer-claims-canonical-spec.md`**. This file tracks **state + what's next**, not the
design.

**Standing caveats (carry forward):**
- **n-DMP / REPRODUCED is EARNED on real betas (2026-06-17 Phase A; IDH source upgraded 2026-06-18).**
  The genome-wide n-DMP count licenses at REPRODUCED on a **real TCGA-LAML HM450 cohort** (IDH-mut vs WT;
  194×378,894; e-value → ∞; legs agree; full content-address). **IDH calling swapped to cBioPortal
  complete genotyping (`tcga_laml_idh@2`, 2026-06-18):** IDH-mut **n=10 → 36** (cBioPortal
  `laml_tcga_pub@86690e1`; WT now = genotyped-and-not-hotspot, never a missing-data default;
  dropped_ungenotyped=0 so betas are byte-identical to @1, only labels+metadata change — captured by a
  `group_digest`). Non-diluted, the DMP count rose 50,339 → **115,405** (floor 18,945). Betas = local Xena
  GDC-Level-3 matrix. Run caveat: sex-chrom QC skipped (Xena lacks chr/pos). Data local-only, gitignored;
  builders in `data/tcga_laml/` (gitignored).
- **Region-Δβ re-run at proper power (2026-06-18) — held-out e-value 0.867 → 5.672, still PENDING (honest).**
  On `@2` (now ~18 IDH-mut/split vs ~5 at n=10) the held-out top-10k betting e-value (Δβ > pre-registered
  τ=0.10) jumped to **5.672** — it crossed break-even (>1), so the held-out data now genuinely favors the
  effect; the n=10 power diagnosis was correct. It is **still WITHHELD**: the e-LOND first-test discovery
  threshold is **1/α₁ = 32.90** (q=0.05, γ₁=6/π²) and 5.672 < 32.9 → PENDING. **τ stays fixed at 0.10 — no
  tuning.** Clearing 32.9 as a §2E REPLICATED **product** e₁·e₂ needs each cohort ≈ √32.9 = 5.74; the
  single-cohort e=5.67 is right at that bar, so **a 2nd real cohort would license it at REPLICATED**.
  Region-Δβ remains **UNEARNED** (FDR-withheld, not refuted). **Still synthetic:** REPLICATED (needs the
  2nd real cohort). [next: 2nd real cohort → §2E REPLICATED]
- `semantic_run_id` is the **Python** digest; an R-parity golden fixture is deferred (needs an R
  serializer). [menu item 7]
- Adapter independence is now **partly hardened**: local adapter registries derive
  `implementation_hash` from adapter implementation bytecode, and licensed `Satisfaction`s record the
  registry credential identities that justified the independent air gap. Registry owner/trust metadata
  remains operator-authored. [roadmap 1c residual]
- The two methylation adapters are **reproducibility-independent, not error-independent** (same estimand,
  same data) → the single-cohort demo licenses at **REPRODUCED**. **§2E now expresses the stronger tier:**
  a claim reproduced across two cohorts with distinct `dimnames_hash` licenses at **REPLICATED** (the
  cross-cohort independence that error-decorrelates). **§E now gates this (2026-06-19):** when runs declare
  `shared_cause_factors`, REPLICATED additionally requires every pairwise Jaccard < 0.5 — else REPRODUCED,
  with the e-value product withheld (factors operator-asserted; bundled SE-Contracts now carry flat
  factors and `materialization_map` propagates cohort-A factors, so the gate is active on bundled
  contract-backed runs). The REPLICATED demo runs on a **2nd synthetic
  cohort** (`epicv2_casectrl_demo_b`) — still exercised, not earned, until a real 2nd cohort is swapped in.

### ▶ NEXT — historical (2026-06-22 plan, superseded)

> **SUPERSEDED (2026-06-25) — historical.** This section reflects the 2026-06-22 plan. Since then H0.1, H0.1b, and the local-signing half of H1.A1 shipped; "real signing deferred" and the signing-as-next-move notes below are **out of date** (see the **UPDATE 2026-06-25** block at the top of this file). Current priorities: (a) run the H0.1b real-pins bootstrap; (b) H1.A2 real 2nd cohort. Authoritative forward plan: `docs/superpowers/2026-06-23-remaining-roadmap.md` (reconciled 2026-06-25).

**Recently shipped** (most recent first): **Calibration ledger + certificate — closes the
build-path critical-path proof** (2026-06-22, merged `9e54684`) — makes the corpus headline `q`
*validated, not asserted*, and emits it as a shareable certificate. Warrant-tiered ledger (pure
`protocol/calibration.py`): **DEFINITIONAL** = realized FDR (mean per-batch FDP over *mixed*
batches) by running Beta-distributed synthetic data through the **real gate** behind a scoped
contract-root contextvar — the only tier that feeds the headline `q`; **ANCHORED** = warrant
survival from the corpus's own defeat/drift events (event-identity per `license_epoch`, JSONL event
log + `EpochAllocator` + a gated byte-identical-off `NodeRunner` hook); **ATTESTED** = schema stub.
No-laundering is enforced (`feeds_headline_q` computed property; only DEFINITIONAL realized-FDR is
the headline). Certificate = in-toto/SLSA Statement **+** calibration block inside a signed DSSE
payload (`Certificate`/`build_certificate`/`certificate_dsse_envelope`; `certify`/`calibrate` CLIs;
new `[calibrate]` numpy extra). **Instrument, not a gate** — no claim status changes, Corpus stays 4;
existing `export-attestation` byte-identical. Subagent-driven 10-task TDD build, whole-branch
reviewed; check-all.sh ALL GREEN (1184 tests). Verified end-to-end: 114 licensed across 12 synthetic
batches, realized FDR 0.0000 (conservative gate). spec+plan
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-22-calibration-ledger-and-certificate*`. · **Attestation DSSE export — North-Star arc 2, slice 2**
(2026-06-21) — `--format dsse` NDJSON of unsigned DSSE envelopes (`DsseEnvelope`, `signatures: []`);
records-based refactor (`AttestationRecord` + `build_attestation_records`; bundle output byte-identical,
captured golden); `build_attestation_statements` projection; public API extended (`AttestationRecord`,
`build_attestation_records`, `build_attestation_statements`, `DsseEnvelope`, `DsseSignature`, `dsse_envelope`);
stdlib-only/deterministic/additive. Deferred: real signing (Sigstore/Rekor/DSSE PAE) = slice 3.
spec+plan `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-21-attestation-dsse-export*`. · **Standards-skin attestation export — North-Star arc 2, slice 1**
(2026-06-21) — `export-attestation <corpus>` emits one deterministic **in-toto Statement v1 / SLSA Provenance
v1** attestation per LICENSED claim **+ GA4GH DRS** object docs, built from the content-address we already
compute (`dimnames_hash`/`profile_hash`/`semantic_run_id`) with the air-gap credential pair as the SLSA
`builderDependencies` (the recompute gate = the trusted builder; independence = its security guarantee). Pure
umbrella module `src/polymer_claims/attestation.py` (typed frozen DTOs + builder) + IO-only
`resolve_contract_index`; stdlib-only, no signing/network/clock; additive/byte-identical when off. The
recompute gate re-expressed as the GA4GH/in-toto/SLSA trust fabric (north-star §4 seam #3). spec+plan
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-21-standards-skin-attestation*`. Deferred (later slices):

(REPRODUCED / REPLICATED) · reinstatement → PENDING · n-DMPs-at-FDR. SHAs + one-line summaries in the
*Done* checklist below; design rationale in `docs/superpowers/archive/specs/`.

**▶ PHASE A SHIPPED — the real-data swap is *earned* for n-DMP/REPRODUCED.** The genome-wide n-DMP count
licenses at REPRODUCED on a real TCGA-LAML HM450 cohort (see Standing caveats above for the numbers +
run caveats). Archived plan:
`docs/superpowers/archive/plans/2026-06-17-phase-a-real-data-swap.md` (Tasks 1–7, spec +
implementation). Local-only run builders live in `data/tcga_laml/` (gitignored).

**▶ REGION-Δβ re-run at proper power on `tcga_laml_idh@2` — held-out e 0.867 → 5.672, still PENDING
(FDR-withheld, NOT refuted).** The honest region reduction (no hand-picked region): select the top-10k
DMPs on a discovery half, test Δβ on the held-out half. After the IDH-source swap (n=10→36; ~18
IDH-mut/split): discovery/test = 97/97; held-out betting e-value (Δβ > pre-registered τ=0.10) = **5.672**
— it **crossed break-even (>1)**, confirming the n=10 power diagnosis (the held-out data now genuinely
favors the effect). **Still WITHHELD:** the e-LOND first-test discovery threshold is **1/α₁ = 32.90**
(q=0.05, γ₁=6/π²) and 5.672 < 32.9 → PENDING. **τ stays fixed at 0.10 (no post-hoc tuning).** The reusable
severity machinery is `src/polymer_claims/split_select.py` (`stratified_split` / `split_contract` /
`top_k_hypermethylated`). Plans: design + impl at
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-18-idh-source-swap-design.md` +
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-idh-source-swap.md`; the n=10 attempt at
`docs/superpowers/archive/plans/2026-06-17-region-delta-beta-split.md`.
Region-Δβ remains **UNEARNED** (FDR-withheld, not refuted). **Recommended next
moves (re-ordered):** (a) **a 2nd real cohort → §2E REPLICATED** gold tier — the product e₁·e₂ needs each
cohort ≈ √32.9 = 5.74 and the single-cohort e=5.67 sits right at that bar, so a comparable 2nd cohort
**would license region-Δβ at REPLICATED** (now the highest-leverage move); (b) **a real HM450 probe
manifest** so sex-chrom QC bites + a real platform `profile_hash`; (c) **north-star arc-2 standards skin** (in-toto/SLSA/DRS attestation — the safe first slice of arc 2) or **Phase B** (autonomous `MethylGenerationAdapter`, `docs/superpowers/2026-06-16-autonomous-hypothesis-loop.md`) — both non-blocked; with the sheaf gauge opening arc-3 and arc-1 epistemic core substantially done, arc-2 is now the more natural next candidate. [IDH-source swap (a fuller IDH cohort) —
DONE 2026-06-18.]

**▶ §2E REPLICATED (move a) — STAGED, BLOCKED on data access (key finding 2026-06-18).** Attempted on
branch `feat/replicated-second-cohort` (spec+plan committed: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-18-replicated-second-cohort*`).
Cohort B = **GSE86409** (Study Alliance Leukemia adult-AML, HM450, n=79) — its 419k-probe betas are
public + downloaded, BUT a hunt across GEO returned a hard lesson: **no open independent HM450 adult-AML
cohort exposes machine-readable per-sample IDH status.** GSE86409 / GSE159907 keep IDH only in paper
supplements or controlled-access dbGaP (phs001657); the GEO series that DO carry per-sample `idh1:`/`idh2:`
(GSE146173, GSE98350) are RNA/seq, not 450K. **So earning REPLICATED on real data is *data-access*-gated,
not code-gated** — the binding machinery (`build_replication_inputs` / `replication_bindings`) already
works. Ingestion + run scripts are written & compile-clean (`data/sal_aml/build_contract_gse86409.py`
reads a user-supplied `data/sal_aml/idh_status.tsv` keyed by eAML-NGS title or GSM, drops unlabeled
samples — no WT dilution; `data/sal_aml/run_replicated.py` gates the product vs 32.9). **Resume =** drop
`data/sal_aml/idh_status.tsv` (SAL PMID 28366934 supplement / dbGaP phs001657) → run the two scripts. **No
fabrication of genotypes — the run waits on real labels.** Non-data-blocked alternatives if REPLICATED
stays gated (both pure-code, no external data): **Phase D slice 1 (pre-registration ledger) — DONE
2026-06-19**; Phase D slices 1+2 and §E common-cause independence all shipped 2026-06-19; current non-blocked candidates are the north-star **arc-2 standards skin** or **Phase B** (autonomous hypothesizer).

**▶ PHASE B FIRST SLICE SHIPPED — methylation hypothesizer.** `MethylGenerationAdapter` now mirrors
`MeanDiffGenerationAdapter`: a constrained LLM DSL emits executable `region_delta_beta` / `n_dmps`
methylation claims against SE-Contracts, with validation, deterministic IDs, generated provenance, and
tests. Live wiring is available as `serve --methyl-data`, which runs methylation adapters plus
content-address/e-value gating. This is the autonomous hypothesis loop's first real-methylation agent
surface; the gate still decides license/reject/PENDING.

**▶ §2E LIVE WIRING + ASSET CATALOG SHIPPED.** `NodeRunner` can now compute `replication_map` inputs
live via `replication_bindings`, so a live tick can license a bound methylation claim at
`independence_tier=replicated` instead of requiring a hand-built `run_cycle(...)` call. The viewer
already displays `independence_tier`. Phase B also has a small methylation data-asset catalog
(`methylation_asset_catalog`) that lists bundled SE-Contract fixtures and locally generated TCGA
contracts when present; the methylation generator prompt is now metadata-driven rather than hardcoded.

Other safe slices:

1. **§2E follow-ups** — viewer tier display + live-node `replication_map` wiring are done. Remaining:
   bind a **real** second cohort when available so REPLICATED is earned, not only exercised.
2. **n-DMPs as a REPLICATED second reduction** — run the n-DMP count on a second cohort and multiply the
   two count-enrichment e-values (combines §2E's REPLICATED machinery with the new reduction). ~1 slice.
3. **ROBUSTLY_BLAMED wiring** — wire the Duhem robust-blame REJECTED verdict into the protocol and stamp
   it (tiny; the enum value is reserved). Optional/legibility.

**Deferred / blocked-on-external (supervised):** Python/R hash parity (needs the R side);
arc-2 slice 3 — real signing (Sigstore/cosign/Rekor + the DSSE PAE) on top of the shipped unsigned DSSE export — deferred (no external service/keys yet). Literal per-attack e-value
combination is **largely a mirage** — Phase 2.2 already caught its sound core; don't build a generic
combination.

**Candidate next moves:** With the **certificate shipped (2026-06-22)**, the build-path critical-path proof is *closed* — a real claim, a real independence check, a validated (not asserted) `q`, emitted as a shareable certificate. The natural next is build-path **step 4 — one legible wedge claim**: the **Linchpin Layer C Variant Adjudication Engine** (untouched, highest-leverage demonstrable artifact) or the AML epistemic twin. **Calibration follow-ups (non-blocking):** ATTESTED ingestion (no external source yet); an exposure-weighted hazard model for `q_anchored`; a real-claim `q`-calibration *resolution* loop (DEFINITIONAL is validated on a synthetic generating model — a disclosed assumption). Also open: arc-2 slice 3 (real signing — Sigstore/cosign/Rekor/DSSE PAE, now atop both the unsigned DSSE attestation export *and* the certificate); arc-3 deepening (hyperbolic/Lorentz layout, instrument→gate). Real-2nd-cohort §2E REPLICATED stays data-blocked (needs a real `idh_status.tsv`).

  non-loopback bind guard · machine-clean JSON · `ARCHITECTURE_CURRENT.md` + `GLOSSARY.md` · v1.2 frozen
  banners
- ✅ Adapter trust registry (`67f98e3`) — the independence gate (registry core done); **byte-hash hardening DONE (`d3be2bb`, 2026-06-20)** — `implementation_hash` byte-derived from adapter bytecode, `Satisfaction` records the credential-witness pair. Residual: registry owner/trust metadata remains operator-authored (roadmap 1c).
- ✅ Tier-C (`2b7ccb5`): viewer `CONTRACT_VERSION` + 6-axis strength validator · `run_cycle` output
  revalidation · packaging metadata

**Credibility arc + CES:**
- ✅ M1 structural-equivalence status (`Status.STRUCTURAL` — no more false LICENSED on structural
  collapse) · earned-strength · relational graph embedding v1 (signed-Laplacian eigenmap, silhouette 0.62)
  · live spectral layout (`procrustes-embedding-alignment`) — eigenmap as the live `NodeRunner` default,

  Waudby-Smith-Ramdas betting e-value + the hard 4-way VERIFY gate
- ✅ 2.2 defeat-as-e-value-update + alpha-wealth refund (`eef6143`) — `FDRTest.retracted` tombstone;

- ✅ §2E tiered independence (`feat/2e-tiered-independence`) — REPRODUCED / REPLICATED; product e-value
  across independent cohorts as one e-LOND test; 2nd synthetic cohort demo (design rationale in archive/specs/)
- ✅ Reinstatement → PENDING (`feat/reinstatement-pending`) — `RejectionReason` marker + INTEGRATE
  reinstatement block; a defeat-rejected claim reopens to re-test when its attacker falls (symmetric to
  Phase 2.2); refuted claims stay terminal (design rationale in archive/specs/)
- ✅ n-DMPs-at-FDR (`feat/n-dmps-at-fdr`) — second methylation reduction; per-probe-significant DMP count
  licenses on a one-sample count-enrichment betting e-value; two pooled-t legs agree on the count
  (air-gap); umbrella-only (design rationale in archive/specs/)

- ✅ **§E common-cause — earn REPLICATED on low shared-cause overlap** (2026-06-19) — makes the §5b
  implementation-independence condition derived+evidenced (Reichenbach screening-off, first concrete form):
  grammar `shared_cause_jaccard` + `SHARED_CAUSE_TAU=0.5`; `MaterializationContext.shared_cause_factors` +
  `Licensing.shared_cause_overlap`; overlap-aware `independence_tier_of` + `cohorts_error_independent` +
  `max_shared_cause_overlap` (REPLICATED requires distinct dimnames AND every pairwise Jaccard < τ, else
  REPRODUCED); umbrella `build_replication_inputs` gates the e₁·e₂ product on the same predicate (cohort-A
  proxy built from its contract — review caught+fixed an inert-in-production bug); verify records the
  overlap + topology/viewer surface it. Additive/byte-identical when off; subagent-driven (5-task plan,
  whole-branch opus review). spec+plan `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-19-common-cause-replicated*`.
  **Deferred (full §E):** the real per-implementation causal DAG (vs the flat factor set), the formal

  byte-derived/credential-backed provenance for `shared_cause_factors`.
- ✅ **Sheaf consistency gauge** (2026-06-21) — cellular sheaf over the claims graph; scalar-ℝ stalks on
  Quantity-leaf claims; equivalence edges = agreement, defeat edges = sign-flipped antagonism (generalizing
  the signed-Laplacian embedding); Laplacian → inconsistency energy (consistency radius) + dim H⁰ + localized
  H¹ frustration obstructions; `export-consistency` CLI + cheap live headline (`TopologyExport.consistency`)
  on the topology frame; instrument not a gate; pure protocol extractor (`protocol/sheaf.py`) + numpy spectrum
  (`polymer_claims/sheaf_spectrum.py`) behind `[embed]`. spec+plan
  `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-21-sheaf-consistency-gauge*`. **Deferred:** stalk enrichments
  (standardized-effect, ℝ²(value,uncertainty)), unit-conversion registry (ρ≠1),
  instrument→gate.
- ✅ **Sheaf gauge live viz** (2026-06-21) — the viewer renders the gauge behind one opt-in "consistency
  overlay" toggle: falling energy HUD + sparkline, per-claim tension halos, animated H¹ frustration-cycle
  overlay, obstruction panel (click-to-focus) + node-tension display. New throttled `GET /consistency` route
  (snapshot-then-release, never blocks ticks). Gauge corrections landed first: **P1** per-frame headline is
  energy-only (`ConsistencyHeadline.spectral_gap` now `float|None`, no per-tick eigendecomposition); **P3**
  `per_claim_tension` is a nonnegative edge-share attribution (valid as opacity). Off ⇒ rendered view
  unchanged; `[embed]`-absent ⇒ degrades silently. Demo: `data/demo/frustrated_cycle_corpus.json` →
  exactly one H¹ obstruction. spec+plan `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-21-sheaf-viewer-viz*`.

  hyperbolic/Lorentz layout, instrument→gate.
- ✅ **Adapter-independence hardening** (`d3be2bb`, 2026-06-20) — byte-derived `implementation_hash` from adapter bytecode; licensed `Satisfaction` records the credential-witness pair that justified the air gap; §E `shared_cause_factors` activated on bundled SE-Contracts.
- ✅ **Standards-skin attestation export — arc 2, slice 1** (2026-06-21) — `export-attestation <corpus>` → deterministic in-toto Statement v1 / SLSA Provenance v1 + GA4GH DRS per LICENSED claim; keyed by existing content-addresses (`dimnames_hash`/`profile_hash`/`semantic_run_id`); air-gap credential pair = SLSA `builderDependencies`; pure umbrella module `attestation.py`; stdlib-only, no signing/network; additive/byte-identical off; 31 attestation tests. spec+plan `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-21-standards-skin-attestation*`.
- ✅ **Attestation DSSE export — arc 2, slice 2** (2026-06-21) — `--format dsse` NDJSON of unsigned DSSE envelopes (`DsseEnvelope`, `signatures: []`); records-based refactor (`AttestationRecord` + `build_attestation_records`; bundle byte-identical, captured golden); `build_attestation_statements` projection; six new public names exported (`AttestationRecord`, `build_attestation_records`, `build_attestation_statements`, `DsseEnvelope`, `DsseSignature`, `dsse_envelope`); stdlib-only/deterministic/additive; umbrella test count → 327. Deferred: real signing (Sigstore/Rekor/DSSE PAE) = slice 3. spec+plan `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-21-attestation-dsse-export*`.
- ✅ **Calibration ledger + certificate** (2026-06-22, merged `9e54684`) — `q` *validated, not asserted*, closing the build-path critical-path proof's last open piece. Warrant-tiered ledger (pure `protocol/calibration.py` — `ResolutionRecord`/`CalibrationLedger`/`calibration_summary`/`anchored_resolutions`): **DEFINITIONAL** realized FDR (mean per-batch FDP over mixed batches) by driving Beta-distributed synthetic data through the **real gate** (betting e-value + air-gap + e-LOND, reached via a scoped contract-root contextvar in `contracts/__init__.py`); **ANCHORED** warrant survival from defeat/drift events (event-identity per `license_epoch`); **ATTESTED** stub. No-laundering: `feeds_headline_q` computed property, only DEFINITIONAL realized-FDR is the headline. Impure umbrella: `calibration_harness.py` (`[calibrate]` numpy extra), `calibration_store.py` (JSONL event log + `EpochAllocator` + ANCHORED tap), gated `NodeRunner` `calibration_path` hook (byte-identical off). Certificate: `attestation.py` `Certificate`/`build_certificate`/`certificate_dsse_envelope` (Statement + calibration block in the signed DSSE payload) + `certify`/`calibrate` CLIs; `export-attestation` byte-identical. Instrument, not a gate; Corpus stays 4. Subagent-driven 10-task TDD build (whole-branch reviewed; one mid-build regression — the contextvar default capturing `_DIR` at import — caught+fixed). check-all.sh ALL GREEN (1184 tests). Deferred: ATTESTED ingestion, `q_anchored` hazard model, real signing. spec+plan `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-22-calibration-ledger-and-certificate*`.

## Invariants / working agreements (don't relearn)

- `grammar/` must NEVER import `polymer_formalclaim` (enforced by `grammar/tests/test_isolation.py`);
  `protocol/` depends one-way on `grammar/` (isolation-tested).
- `grammar/` + `protocol/` are **pure/deterministic + numpy-free** (no clock/random/IO; time-like inputs
  are passed in). The ONLY impurity is the umbrella node/server. **`Corpus` = exactly 4 collections**
  (claims, defeat_edges, equivalences, fdr_ledger).
- All models subclass `_Model` (frozen, `extra="forbid"`); **collections are tuples** (deep immutability
  + content-addressing). No `dict`/`list` fields on models.
- New cross-cutting fields land **additive/optional** (`X | None = None`) with a present-only-when-Y
  validator. Opt-in features default to byte-identical behavior when off.
- numpy lives behind the umbrella `[embed]` extra; `embedding.py` / `methyl_adapters.py` are NOT
  re-exported, so base import stays numpy-free.
- Tests: per-package `uv run pytest -q` + `uv run ruff check src tests`; full gate `scripts/check-all.sh`.
  TDD: failing test first.
- Merge feature work to `main` `--no-ff`; **`main` is now pushed to `origin`** (the account flag is
  RESOLVED — 2026-06-19, `origin/main == main`). The old "local-only, never push" rule is retired. No
  active CI yet, so `check-all.sh` is still the pre-merge gate. Repo is a **single trunk** — no long-lived
  feature branches; the 2026-06-19 reconcile pruned all stale local + remote branches.

  separate research) is removed from the live code AND genericized in the historical CES docs (case/control,
  `pinned_design` profile; local R-pipeline paths + the real cross-reactive digest stripped) — 2026-06-15.
  **Still to do before any public release** (external users won't have this content): genericize the remaining
  **Polymer Genomics / Boris / PlumberClient** integration references in the CES design docs; strip the
  `~/Desktop/Research/topics/epistemic-claim-foundations/...` design-source absolute paths cited across the
  protocol specs + this file. (The v1.2 plugin/corpus fixtures that named other research projects left
  with the v1.2 tree, moved out of the repo 2026-06-17.) None affect the running system — pure
  documentation/context hygiene.
- **Adapter-independence residual hardening** (roadmap 1c): owner/trust credential provenance is still
  operator-authored; local implementation hashes are now byte-derived and satisfactions record the
  credential pair.
- **Earned-strength 2d:** `evidence_against_null` from a real test statistic with n (now partly
  subsumed by the e-value gate).
- **I2 / I1:** `grounded_extension` ~O(N³) worklist rewrite + untrusted-corpus ingestion size/depth
  bounds (only bites with large untrusted corpora — federated layer).
- **Vector leaves** (`QuantityVectorLeaf`): a DMP is vector-valued; scalar reduction is an honest
  simplification until a claim needs the full vector.
- **Card/viewer value display** for `stats::mean_diff` plans (computed value + ✓✗ only populated for
  `builtin::const` today).
- **Multi-dataset drift** (CES-4 single-world `current` → per-claim) · per-frame viewer drift annotation
  ("knowledge breathing").
- **User-gated:** PyPI publish · polymerbio.org viewer integration · federated / BYO-compute
  (`POST /inject` hook).
